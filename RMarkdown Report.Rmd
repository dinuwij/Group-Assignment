This marketing report and manual was done using RMarkDown. It's an automatic report that will change every time the data is updated. 

In this report, you will first find some insights about the datamart created and then you will find an appendix with all variables of the datamart and a short explanation.




### This graphs show you the age distribution of the customers of BWIN:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
#We plot a histogram with ggplot2 with specifics attributes and using the flag column:
ggplot(data=datamart_final[datamart_final$IsInActualSportGambling == 1,], aes(x=datamart_final$AGE[datamart_final$IsInActualSportGambling == 1])) + 
  geom_histogram(breaks=seq(18, 90, by=2), 
                 col="red", 
                 fill="blue",
                 na.rm=TRUE,
                 alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title="Age distribution", x="Age", y="Count") + 
     scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(datamart_final$AGE), max(datamart_final$AGE), by = 5))) 

```

For the three tables bellow, they contains information about users regarding their country or their languages. 

#### About the variables, here is a short description of each:

* Total_Gains: is the actual money generated. Note that if the number is negative, it's meaning that the users lost more than they won so it is profitable for the company.
* Avg_BetsPerDay is equal to the average of a number bets per day done by a user
* Age is the average age of the users
* Avg_TotalBets is the average amount bet by users
* Avg_PokerBalance is the average balance of pokers players
* Avg_Poker_Transaction is the average number of transactions done by poker players wether it's a sell or a buy transaction.
*Nb_Users is equal to the number of users.


### Top 5 countries which are bringing the most revenue regardings Gains with at least 500 users
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#We create a new dataset merged on country name to print a table per country
datamart_tibble = as_tibble(datamart_final[datamart_final$IsinDemographics == 1,])

countryRmark = datamart_tibble %>%
  group_by(CountryName) %>% 
  summarise(Total_Gains = round(sum(OverallGains)),
            Avg_BetsPerDay = round(mean(BetsPerDay),2),
            Age = round(mean(AGE),0),
            Avg_TotalBets = round(mean(TotalBets),2), 
            Avg_Poker_Balance = round(mean(Balance),2), 
            Avg_Poker_Transcation = round(mean(Nb_Trans),2), 
            Nb_Users = sum(IsinDemographics)) %>%
  filter(Nb_Users > 500)

#After filtering, we order it :
countryRmark = countryRmark[order(countryRmark$Total_Gains),]


kable(countryRmark[1:5,])

```



### Top 5 countries which are bringing the less revenue regardings Gains with at least 500 users
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#We print the same table in reverse order to have the opposite countries that less profitable
countryRmark = countryRmark[order(-countryRmark$Total_Gains),]


kable(countryRmark[1:5,])
```


### Top 5 most popular languages per number of users:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#We create a new dataset to group on languages to print information about languages
datamart_tibble = as_tibble(datamart_final[datamart_final$IsinDemographics == 1,])

languagesRMark = datamart_tibble %>%
  group_by(`Language Description`) %>% 
  summarise(Nb_Users = sum(IsinDemographics),
            Total_Gains = round(sum(OverallGains)),
            Avg_BetsPerDay = round(mean(BetsPerDay),2),
            Age = round(mean(AGE),0),
            Avg_TotalBets = round(mean(TotalBets),2), 
            Avg_Poker_Balance = round(mean(Balance),2), 
            Avg_Poker_Transcation = round(mean(Nb_Trans),2)) 

languagesRMark = languagesRMark[order(-languagesRMark$Nb_Users),]
kable(languagesRMark[1:5,])

```



### Stakes amount spend per day over all the users:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#We print the stakes amount as an histogram per user using ggplot2
ggplot(data=datamart_final,
       aes(x=datamart_final$StakePerDay)) + 
  geom_histogram(breaks=seq(0, 200, by= 5), 
                 col="red", 
                 fill="blue",
                 na.rm=TRUE,
                 alpha = .2) + 
  labs(title="Stakes per day", x="Stakes", y="Count") + 
     scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(datamart_final$StakePerDay), max(datamart_final$StakePerDay), by = 20))) 
```




### Most comon application sources by number of applicants & most profitable sources:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#We create a new dataset grouped by application description to have insights about sources
datamart_tibble = as_tibble(datamart_final[datamart_final$IsinDemographics == 1,])

SourcesRMark = datamart_tibble %>%
  group_by(`Application Description`) %>% 
  summarise(Nb_Users = sum(IsinDemographics),
            Total_Gains = round(sum(OverallGains)))

SourcesRMark = SourcesRMark[order(-SourcesRMark$Nb_Users),]
SourcesRMark = SourcesRMark[1:5,]
SourcesRMark = SourcesRMark[order(-SourcesRMark$Nb_Users),]



ggplot(data = SourcesRMark, aes(x=`Application Description`, y= Nb_Users)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() + labs(title="Number of users per source", x="Sources", y="Number of users")
```

### Most profitable sources per user:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Now we do the same, but we compute gains per user to compute gains regarding the sources
SourcesRMark2 = SourcesRMark[order(-SourcesRMark$Total_Gains),]
SourcesRMark2 = SourcesRMark2[1:5,]
SourcesRMark2$Gains_per_users = (abs(SourcesRMark2$Total_Gains))/ SourcesRMark2$Nb_Users


ggplot(data = SourcesRMark2, aes(x=`Application Description`, y= Gains_per_users)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() + labs(title="Profit per user per source", x="Sources", y="Profit per user")

```


We've now reached the end of the report part of this document, bellow you will find a table containing all the variables of the datamart and a short description for each.

### Datamart & variables description:

The datamart was created by merging 4 differents files: Demographics, UserDailyAggregation,
PokerChipConversions and ActualSportsGambling. This datamart is a user centric datamart so you will find in this one line per UserID.

```{r,  echo = FALSE}
#We print the description of the datamart computed in an excel before
kable(Descriptions)
```
