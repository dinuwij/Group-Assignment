# Marketing Insights on Online Sports Gambling   
This is a group assignment for the Open Source Programming module. This project is created by Lopez Zeron Alejandro, Wijayaweera Dinu and Pavot Sebastien for the final group project. This project has utilized:
* **R** for data preparation
* **R Markdown** for reporting
* **Shiny** for visualization


We have created several outputs in this project.

1. As our initial most step, we prepared a marketing datamart with value adding metrics for Internet Sports Gambling which would assist in gaining insights to improve their business.  
2. As our second output we have created a concise yet insightful Marketing data manual using R Markdown. It includes statistics and graphs which can be be helpful for the marketing analysts of the Internet Sports Gambling company.
3. The third output is a Shiny application which provides interactive features for the users to investigate marketing data.
