# Marketing Insights on Online Sports Gambling   
This is the the group assignment for the Open Source Programming module. This project is created by Lopez Zeron Alejandro, Wijayaweera Dinu and Pavot Sebastien for the final group project.

We have created several outputs in this project.

As our initial most step, we prepared a marketing datamart with value adding metrics for Internet Sports Gambling which would assist in gaining insights to improve their business.  
As our second output we have created a concise yet insightful Marketing data manual using R Markdown. It includes statistics and graphs which can be be helpful for the marketing analysts of the Internet Sports Gambling company.
The third output is a Shiny application which provides interactive features for the users to investigate marketing data.
